# Appstore and Playstore

Dataquest.io Guided project.

Links to the original datasets are below:

## Comparison.ipynb

[For those who don't have and don't want Jupyter notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/garethhay/appstore_playstore/blob/master/Comparison.ipynb).

This is pretty much straight as per the guided project. Including all the spelling mistakes as this was done before I installed the [Jupyter Notebook Extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions).

The conclusion is as per the data but the data needs further work to remove the apps that have gone hyperscale.

## Tweak.ipynb

[For those who don't have and don't want Jupyter notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/garethhay/appstore_playstore/blob/master/Tweak.ipynb).

This is a slightly updated version introducing panda towards the end of the guided project to do some further analysis on the games genre.

Also builds on the [Playing with Matplotlib](github.com/garethhay/playing_with_matplotlib/) repo to add some graphs towards the end.
